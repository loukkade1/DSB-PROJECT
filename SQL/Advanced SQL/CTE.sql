/* 
Common Table Expression (CTE)
- WITH clause / subquery (is the nested query within a larger query) 
i.e. select (retrieved value that can be used in the main query) in select (main query) -> select in select
- CTE is defining variables to be used in that particular session
- An inner query is a function or query that is inside parentheses. It will run first within the parentheses, and then the outer query will run

Tips:  We write the formula inside the parentheses first to avoid confusion.

--SELECT Avg(milliseconds) from tracks

-- subquery (Example) apply with syntax above:
SELECT name from tracks
where milliseconds > (
  SELECT AVG(milliseconds) from tracks
  );
  
/*  If we donâ€™t use a subquery in the syntax above, we need to perform multiple steps, such as calculating AVG(millisecond) first, 
to get the values to use in the syntax above 

- Using a CTE (Common Table Expression) or creating variables is equivalent to a subquery but written in a shorter format.
- WITH is used to declare a variable by name, which we can then use directly in the FROM clause.
i.e. variable 1: (select *______), variable 2: (select * ______)
